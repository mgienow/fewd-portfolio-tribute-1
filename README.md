# Project: fewd-portfolio-tribute 

Your assignment: build a single page website that is a tribute to someone -- anyone, living or dead or even imaginary -- who you admire or find inspiring. 

1. **Create a new project repository in your own GitHub account.** On the command line, set up a new directory called "Tribute-Project" and create (empty) index.html and main.css files. 

2. **Build out the HTML page structure in index.html.** Use appropriate semantic markup syntax. 
  > -   The page should consist, at minimum, of a title, an image with optional caption, and three separate paragraphs of text content. The text content should include a quote from the person. _Possible semantic elements could include \<figure\>, \<figcaption\>, \<article>, and \<main>._ 
>  -   Use at least one external link (hint: <a></a>) in your text, which links to an outside site giving additional information about the subject of the tribute page. *Hint #2: You must give your element an attribute of "target" and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").*
>  -   se one instance of an **ID** and one instance of a **class** in your markup.
>  -   Within the HTML <header> be sure to insert an element linking the markup to the stylesheet.

3. **Inside your *main.css* file, write the CSS style rules that will be associated with HTML elements, IDs and classes in your markup.** Use the appropriate CSS property-value declarations to:
>  -   Center your page's content.
>  -   Set a background color
>  -   Use at least one text color that is not black (default), and two (or more) font families. 

4. **Remember to save, stage, and commit often!** :arrow_up:

5. **Once you're done, push the final project to GH.** Your webpage will be visible at http://yourUserName.github.io/repositoryName. Submit this URL to Slack. Congrats! :sparkles:
